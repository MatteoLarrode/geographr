\description{
A data set containing a lookup between 2022 England NHS Trusts and 2011 LSOA
areas.
}
\details{
The population size of an MSOA is much smaller than the population of people
who attend a given Trust. This means that the proportion of patients from an
MSOA that go to a Trust will be much higher than the proprotion of patients
from a Trust that came from an MSOA. This is because Trusts serve many more
MSOA's than MSOA patients go to different trusts.
