## Overview

geographr is an R package for mapping UK geographies.


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("britishredcrosssociety/geographr")
```

## Development

This project is under active development. Currently, the package is intended to:  

1. distribute uk geographical geospatial data sets  
2. provide functions to help lookup and aggregate between these different data sets  

To add datasets to the package:

- Add a script to generate the data in `/data-raw`, adding `usethis::use_data(DATASET, overwrite = TRUE)` to the end of the file, replacing the name of `DATASET` with the object in the R environment containing the data. This will save the generated data into `/data`.
- Add documentation for the dataset in `R/data.R`. 
- Update `LICENSE` by adding the license of the new data set.

To add functions:

- Add aggregate functions to `R/aggregate.R`
- Add lookup functions to `R/lookup.R`

## UK geographies guide

### Census

#### OA
Census output areas (OA) are the smallest unit for which census data are published - they were initially generated to support publication of 2001 Census outputs and contain at least 40 households and 100 persons, the target size being 125 households. They were built up from postcode blocks after the census data were available, with the intention of standardising population sizes, geographical shape and social homogeneity (in terms of dwelling types and housing tenure). 

#### SOAs
Super Output Areas (SOAs) are a set of geographical areas developed following the 2001 census, initially to facilitate the calculation of the Indices of Deprivation 2004. The aim was to produce a set of areas of consistent size, whose boundaries would not change (unlike electoral wards). They are an aggregation of adjacent Output Areas with similar social characteristics. Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) typically contain 4 to 6 OAs with a population of around 1500. Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) on average have a population of 7,200.

### Administrative

#### Electoral Wards
Electoral wards/divisions are the key building blocks of UK administrative geography. They are the spatial units used to elect local government councillors in metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and the London boroughs in England; unitary authorities in Wales; council areas in Scotland; and district council areas in Northern Ireland.

#### Local Authorities
English local authority districts (LAD) (both metropolitan and non-metropolitan), London boroughs and unitary authorities average around 23 electoral wards/divisions each, Northern Irish district council areas around 22, Scottish council areas around 11 and Welsh unitary authorities about 40. Population counts can vary substantially, even within a single LAD, but the national average is about 5,500. 

### Health

#### Integrated Care Systems

Originally coined sustainability and transformation plan (STP), then accountable care systems in 2017, they were renamed in February 2018 to [Integrated Care Systems](https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/integrated-care-systems/) (ICS). They cover the whole of England and form part of the [NHS Long Term Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Long_Term_Plan). In an ICS, NHS organisations, in partnership with local councils and others, take collective responsibility for managing resources, delivering NHS care, and improving the health of the population they serve. ICS are supposed to be bring together NHS trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups and local authorities.

#### Clnical Comission Groups

Replacement for PCT’s. They work with patients and healthcare
professionals and in partnership with local communities and local
authorities. The aim of this is to give GPs and other clinicians the
power to influence commissioning decisions for their patients. CCGs are
groups of general practices (GPs) which come together in each area to
commission the best services for their patients and population. CCGs are
responsible for about 60% of the NHS budget, they commission most
secondary care services.

#### Primary Care Networks

Introduce in January 2019. They provide the opportunity for GP practices
to join networks, each with between 30,000 and 50,000 patients. The
stated aim is to create fully integrated community-based health
services. Most networks are geographically based and, between them,
cover all practices within a clinical commissioning group (CCG)
boundary. There are some exceptions where there were already
well-functioning networks that are not entirely geographically based.
Some networks cross CCG boundaries.

#### NHS Trusts

An NHS trust is an organisational unit within the National Health
Service in England and Wales, generally serving either a geographical
area or a specialised function (such as an ambulance service). As of
April 2020 there are altogether 217 trusts.

#### Primary Care Trusts

Primary care trusts (PCTs) were part of the National Health Service in
England from 2001 to 2013. They were abolished on 31 March 2013 as part
of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, with their work taken over by
clinical commissioning groups.

#### Health Boards
To be added soon.

### Postal

#### Postcodes
Postcodes are alphanumeric references comprising an outward code of 2–4 characters and an inward code of three characters.
